# NaiveBayesClassifiers
My implementation of Gaussian, Bernoulli and Multinomial Naive Bayes classifiers and comparison with scikit-learn's implementation.
They are applied respectively with the Iris, MNIST and Titanic datasets; their performance is evaluated with KFold cross-validation using scikit-learn's cross_val_score function.
